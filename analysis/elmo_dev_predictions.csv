Mrs Thatcher, a recent convert to environmental conservation, clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective: In the past when we identified forms of pollution, we have shown our capacity to act effectively. The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past. We have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent. We are spending £4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone, and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world. Even though this kind of action may cost a lot, I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other…. The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development. Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded (Thatcher 1988). The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government's White Paper (HMSO 1990). While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‘teeth’ and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments (notably those of Agriculture and of Transport), it was none the less a major achievement. Its main sections dealt with the government's approach to the environment (nationally, at the European level and globally), the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect, environmental problems in both rural and urban areas (especially in relation to land-use matters), pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters. Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence. There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment. Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper, the environmental cause seems as strong as ever.

Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations (such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles), are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle. In contrast, soil creation (cf. soil degradation) may require hundreds or thousands of years. In between are variations in phenomena such as El Nino . The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement. In this chapter, the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km. It is, however, impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods: a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades. Conversely, a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects. This therefore has the following consequences: 1. We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends; 2. Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings, we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge (such as via tree rings, palynology, oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change); 3. Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems, collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise; 4. We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced; 5. Irrespective of the use of surrogates, monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards (hence the IGBP (see below) is designed to run for two or three decades); 6.

An example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller (1988). Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) project, carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria. Following Holling (1978) and Grossman (1983), they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels: 1. The lowest, or process, level, is directly and (usually) obviously connected to perceived reality. Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious, simple and linear; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous. This level is readily handled in commercial GIS;, 2. The intermediate, or dynamic, level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events, e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire, frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace. Characteristically, the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential; 3. The top, or strategic, level is the most difficult to explore; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means. Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available. The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‘soft-couple’ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model. Results of running this with different scenarios include ‘time slice’ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area.

Since remote sensing data sets (especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate, transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful (e.g. land cover) data, the processing power required is going to be formidable. Other, non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics. To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage. Parenthetically, the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced. It would be technically possible, for instance, to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world, akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population.

These reports (Pearce 1990; Turner 1990) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change. Pearce (1990), for instance, presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows: 1. The theory and practice of international agreements, viewed in a game theory context; 2. The theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty;, 3. Cost-benefit frameworks, especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects; 4. Definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern Europe and the developing countries; 5. Appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases; 6. Assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest; 7. Economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases; 8. The international politics of climate change; 9. National and global energy options given the greenhouse effect; 10. Trade and global change. Turner (1990) argued that the priorities are as follows: 1. The socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise; 2. Techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects; 3. An assessment of management tools, institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change; 4. Studies of agriculture in relation to climate change; 5. Understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact; 6. The interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics. There is, then, no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change. Some of it is being carried out: in March 1991 ESRC announced a £6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change. However, perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research. In the USA at least, there needs to be an improvement in scientists' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research (see Kitsos and Ashe 1989). All too often, it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous (see Table 9.2).

The work of Carver (see Openshaw et al.1989: Ch. 7) is an interesting example. One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation. Conceptually, what is offered is little more than an automated ‘sieve mapping’ that land-use planners have used for many years, but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software. The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories (which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter). Data layers include geological maps, conservation areas, transport routes, petrochemical facilities and demographic data. As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks (Pl. 10.3); for instance, when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository, 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent . However, adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent; and so on .

Carson thereupon fell out of the contest — or rather announced that he was not standing, for no official nominations had been made. The party officers and Whips were solidly behind Chamberlain, but Law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and, urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken, he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow Long to win. Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist (as was Lansdowne, who led the Unionists in the Lords) and that he had not been entirely loyal to Balfour since the referendum pledge. Long was supported by the bulk of the English county members but by few of the party's men of talent.

There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence, since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations, but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime. The reason for this is not difficult to find: the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree, whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable. Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects, the victim retains his or her life and, therefore, the possibility of further pleasures and achievements, whereas death is final. This finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another, and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders, in the absence of some excuse or justification.",train,147,5,5,0,1,acj-fragment01,causing,7,0,,,,,cause,"For practical purposes , the culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar .",0,0,0
ACJ,1,7,academic,acj-fragment01_73_73_24_1_weighing,"English criminal law has two degrees of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder — first-degree murder, requiring premeditation, and second- and third-degree murder, covering lesser shades of culpability. In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions, leaving a single offence of criminal homicide. That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage: the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone. The jury would have no role in most homicide cases, since a plea of guilty would be the norm. Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide: pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent, since there would be the possibility of argument in court (if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence), and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing. Moreover, the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law, which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals. The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way, but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills. That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder. Where there is no capital punishment, however, the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (l)) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3 (m)).",train,1930,73,73,1620,1,acj-fragment01,weighing,26,1,,,,,weigh,"Where there is no capital punishment , however , the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling ( see Chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration ( see Chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) .",1,1,1

This has been the subject of a number of House of Lords decisions, and yet the definition is still not clear and settled. Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged, or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission. In this way, both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent, although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or ‘virtual’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred. How would this test be applied? In many cases the word ‘intent’ is used without elaboration, but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary. A fairly typical set of facts is provided by Nedrick (1986), where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to ‘burn her out’. One night he went to her house, poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door, and set it alight. One of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire. When asked why he did it, D replied: ‘Just to wake her up and frighten her.’ A defence of this kind, a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm, requires the full definition to be put to the jury. The question is: granted that D's purpose was to frighten, did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone?

This has considerable practical importance, since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder. It must be shown that the defendant intended (which, again, includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty) to cause really serious injury to someone. The House of Lords confirmed this rule in Cunningham (1981): D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair, causing injuries from which the victim died a week later. D maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill, but there was evidence from which the jury could infer — and did infer — that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm.

If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction, it can be argued that the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule draws the line too low. In terms of principle, the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence (see Chapter 5.2(a)), namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime. By allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction, the law is violating a general principle, turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime. Why should it be necessary to ‘construct’ a murder conviction out of this lesser intent? There are arguments in favour of this: death is final, murder is the gravest crime, and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill. No one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death — that may depend on the victim's physique, on the speed of an ambulance, on the distance from the hospital, and on a range of other medical and individual matters. If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another, it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death, and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label ‘murder’ if death results. The counter-arguments, which would uphold the principle of correspondence, are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder, and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim's life at risk.

AMM,2,8,academic,amm-fragment02_1616_24_11_1_practiced,"Looking at the fossil animal itself, the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains. Sometimes this is a very complex business, particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones. To proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used. One method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues . These do not have to be biologically related organisms. The basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function. Sometimes these similarities are quite obvious: the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits, with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores. But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals, in which opposing teeth co-operate in action, and which can be matched in extinct, unrelated mammals, is a much more subtle matter, involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones. The technique of ‘hunt the analogue’ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists, but it is certainly not a foolproof one, because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms, and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny. The second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a piece of engineering. If the fossil is constructed in a certain way, then there are only a limited number of ‘jobs’ that the structure could perform. The idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one. This assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs. For the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make. Most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive: flyers are aerodynamically efficient, active swimmers have suitable streamlining, herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food, and so on. Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments, but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited. Of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached (unless somebody dredges up a ‘living fossil’ from the depths of the ocean)— there are only varying degrees of probability. But the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue, and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur.",train,1457,1616,24,1191,1,amm-fragment02,practiced,11,0,,,,,practice,"The technique of ‘ hunt the analogue ’ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists , but it is certainly not a foolproof one , because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms , and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny .",0,0,0

AMM,2,8,academic,amm-fragment02_1771_179_5_1_warm,"The balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits. But other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated. In the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded, like all living reptiles (and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles), or warm-blooded, resembling mammals in this respect. Cold-blooded animals have to ‘warm up’ before they can be fully active; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates. For this reason they cannot cope with climates having greatly extended winters. Warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times, and can be more continuously active, but they use far more energy — and hence need more food — than cold-blooded animals of the same size. The posture of many dinosaurs, and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs, was fully erect with the legs beneath the body, and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles (see p. 116). The long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running, and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance (see p. 116). For any kind of prolonged activity, warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage. Under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles. On the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large, and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume, that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller, living reptiles. It has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism, particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy. The armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active, but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded. Protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the Cretaceous plains like furious reptilian rhinoceroses!",train,603,1771,179,462,1,amm-fragment02,warm,6,1,,,,,warm,Cold-blooded animals have to ‘ warm up ’ before they can be fully active ; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates .,0,0,0

They are more likely to be stopped and searched, and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction. At the same time, the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer, in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere, a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property. Improved police methods might help, writes Harrison, to contain the problem.

The spiral in drug abuse and trafficking, with direct consequences for the AIDS epidemic, has created a new kind of alarm. The early 1980s witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking, alongside the global increase. Smoking heroin (‘chasing the dragon’) was one feature of the upsurge. Another was the increased availability of, and demand for, cocaine. Sensational media and police reports in 1989 seemed to suggest an increased use of ‘crack’ among young people in parts of south London, Liverpool, and Birmingham — with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread, as it was reported to be in parts of the United States. for the moment, however, the pattern of drug abuse in Britain remains as varied as ever — with home-produced drugs such as amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines. It is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor — and, less creditably, of class and racial prejudice — that ‘drugs’ and ‘inner cities’are automatically linked in the popular consciousness (MacGregor, 1989a).

The 1970s ‘Urban Programme’ had a social, rather than economic, emphasis and was administered by the Home Office. It was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by Enoch Powell's 1969 ‘rivers of blood’ speech, much as disturbances at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival prompted further steps on the part of the Department of the Environment —‘A riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking’, as Donnison (1987) has pointed out, ‘than any amount of earnest and accurate research’. The Urban Programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the 1969 Local Government Grants (Social Need) Act, which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing, education, and health. Originally, the Programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas. The scope was extended in an ‘enhanced’ Urban Programme, which included economic and environmental as well as social projects, and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe.

Partnership became his slogan — the partnership of public and private brains and money. A new Urban Development Grant was devised, to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment. Heseltine's vision was of ‘partnerships which recognise that there are some things that only governments can pay for, but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable’(p. 156). He claims that serious work on inner-city policy began in 1979: but it was, undoubtedly, the riots of 1981, coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war, which gave impetus to the new approach.

Yet, the irony of the early 1980s — as a deteriorating, but perennial, urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment — was that a Tory government, willy-nilly, found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies. The increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s — new management structures. Thus in 1985 City Action Teams were introduced to each ‘Inner City Partnership’ area to co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved. Task forces, meanwhile, were directed to tackle youth unemployment. By 1986/7 the Urban Programme was supporting 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts in enterprise workshops. It was providing 27,500 training places (often in conjunction with the Manpower Services Commission): some 2,500 buildings were being improved; estate action aimed to tackle run down housing; and a large number of new ‘partnerships’(which some might see as subsidies, or discredited regional grants, in a new guise) were in operation, in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban areas. By 1988 it was claimed that £200 million of Urban Development Grant and Urban Regeneration Grant had successfully ‘levered’ more than £800 million of private investment into the inner cities (although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say). Meanwhile, there were other incentive schemes — Enterprise Zones, for example, and simplified Planning Zones, which aimed to lift tax and planning ‘barriers’ in order to facilitate investment. Indeed, while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities, the Government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas. The Department of the Environment alone by 1988 was spending half a billion pounds out of an Action for Cities total, involving most Home departments, estimated at £3 billion. Perhaps a Labour government would have spent even more: it would certainly have spent it in different ways. It is a curious comment on Thatcherism, however, that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state, and in the need for an independent private sector, has spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history.",train,1983,106,106,1774,1,as6-fragment01,trying,7,0,hand,,hand,,try,"Indeed , while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities , the Government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas .",0,1,1

A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost, whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary. However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance (for a particular task) which is equally available.

Henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment. This article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context. Probation officers, it is argued, are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them. An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described. The paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring. To illustrate the paradigm, reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink. The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders. The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness.",train,1024,13,13,860,1,alp-fragment01,demonstrated,12,0,,,,,demonstrate,The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders .,1,0,1

Indeed, as Bochel (1976) has shown, the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink. Almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the White Paper once again presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention. ‘Alcohol’, the White Paper states, ‘is implicated in a wide variety of crimes, drunken driving, offences of public disorder and domestic violence’(p. 21, para. 4. 14). In describing its vision of effective supervision the White Paper goes on to note: offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly. They learn about the relative strength of different drinks, the amount which is safe to consume, and the pitfalls to avoid (e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‘rounds’)(p. 37, para. 7.11).",train,283,35,35,100,1,alp-fragment01,linked,23,1,,,,,link,"Indeed , as Bochel ( 1976 ) has shown , the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink .",1,1,1

Aware of practitioners' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients, Probation management, in partnership with the voluntary sector, determined to develop an Alcohol Education Course (AEC). By 1986, when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- as for post-sentence clients, that is, alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of cases, a specialist project worker had been appointed. Towards the end of 1986 an AEC was launched and has been running ever since. The aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug. This aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the White Paper's own trinity of ‘aims of supervision’, that is, protection of the public, prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community (p. 35, para. 7.3). These were: 1. To increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent. 2. To instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour. 3.

Such a move towards greater political integration was seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged. But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts. This did not, however, stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all, as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur.

The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer. Yet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive. In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3). It is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines. The Elle feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of the artist. In the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors. There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4). The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work. In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit. While Elle, Vogue and subsequently The Independent (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, rather than her work.

He stayed in, and the recession worsened.

A3E,3,5,news,a3e-fragment03_23_1_6_1_beat,"In the Garden: Planning to beat a leafy retreat at home: In the first of a series for novice gardeners, Anna Pavord stresses the value of careful forethought By ANNA PAVORD PLANTS should come a long way down the list of priorities for the novice gardener. There are many things to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground. The first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is: What is this garden for? If you start writing down some of the responses to that question, you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of elements that will have an important bearing on the design. If there are small children in the equation, there will need to be a flat, soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames. If you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machine, you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it. Some novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all, but conversely, do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence. Their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention. If you are a dedicated sun-worshipper, you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest. It may not be the part nearest the house, though this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made. You may, even as a novice, care so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in. Raised beds built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space. Privacy is an important consideration. A first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one I am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses. Privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbours are concerned. To throw up an impenetrable Berlin Wall between you and them could be tactless. Trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose. Aesthetes among the novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with the soul as with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit. So they should, and when the list of necessities is securely written down, you can ask the second question: How do I want this garden to feel? This question produces as varied a response as the first. Some urban gardeners, as short of space inside as they are out, want their gardens to be extensions of their homes, with a great deal of hard paving, good furniture and lighting. The garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room, gnat-ridden perhaps, damp occasionally, but an important overflow of living space. Closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some Sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisies and scabious. This is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding through their gears on the other. A leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden, but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting, using un-wild plants such as bamboo, acanthus, fig, vine, alchemilla, euphorbia, wisteria. While you are working through this process, take note of the features in the garden that you would like to keep. On a new estate, there may be nothing. In an old garden, there may be a fruit tree, or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that, tidied up, could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it. If you do not know what a tree or shrub is, exercise clemency and give it a year's grace to demonstrate its worth before you turn it over to the axeman. The mood of the garden will dictate its eventual style. It may be clipped classical, random cottage, modern high-tech, or some intensely personal vision of Byzantium, that no one has ever imagined before, but which exists in your head and wants to get out. Do not let anybody, particularly gardening writers, tread on your dreams. All this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window, but it is a vital part of the gardening process. Before you can make, you have to know what it is you are making.",train,157,23,1,0,1,a3e-fragment03,beat,7,1,planning,retreat,planning,retreat,beat,"In the Garden : Planning to beat a leafy retreat at home : In the first of a series for novice gardeners , Anna Pavord stresses the value of careful forethought",1,1,1

She boasted a harpoon walkway, a flybridge, and, above the highest wheel-platform, an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial. The fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair, while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on her bows in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers.

There was a bar beneath which the child's rigid legs were obstinately stuck. The solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy; it was like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice. Theresa gave him a brief, pitying smile, dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while, with the other hand, she collapsed the pushchair, with a single vigorous shake.

She was no longer in the habit of being late: her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy, perhaps to being considerate. He himself, at sixty-two, felt, not quite accurately, that he was now too old, too settled, to be put out, by her or by anyone else. He thought with warmth of her certain approach. There had been a pattern, an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit. She had been a nuisance, a threat, a torment and was now a friend. She had suggested that they look at Van Gogh together, setting up another form of repetition, deliberate, contrived and aesthetic. His play, The Yellow Chair, had first been presented in 1957; he did not like to think too closely about it, as he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work. He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes, a viridian impasto, a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of blue-green, isolated black pot hooks, the painfully clear orange-red spattering. He had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter's obsession with the illuminated material world. He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter's electric quarrels with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles, the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love, the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel, the asylum fears. At first he had thought that he could write a plain, exact verse with no figurative language, in which a yellow chair was the thing itself, a yellow chair, as a round gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower. Sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes, as it were, in this naked way, so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone, the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage, the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums. But it couldn't be done. Language was against him, for a start. Metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower, which not only turned towards but resembled the sun, the source of light.",train,716,17,17,586,1,fet-fragment01,look,6,0,they,,they,,look,"She had suggested that they look at Van Gogh together , setting up another form of repetition , deliberate , contrived and aesthetic .",0,0,1

Indeed, she had respected Angela Morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer's office. ‘I'm sorry you're disappointed,’ she had said to Penelope, ‘but after all there's a lot of money, quite enough for both of us.’ So there was, Grizel Huntley acknowledged, and it would be a great deal better if Penny could manage to think a bit more positively.",train,246,973,183,0,1,ab9-fragment03,sighed,3,0,huntley,,huntley,,sigh,"Mrs Huntley sighed ; her brother whom she had loved , but knew to be self-indulgent to a fault , had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth .",0,0,0
